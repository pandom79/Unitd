- Init process development

    - Create showEmergencyShell func. Currently there is a little bug because argv is null.
      It should contain the first element (command)

    - Review initialization and finalization scripts.
      Predict unitddatapath for the "run" property in the initial and final units.
      Replace it with unitddatapath macro value from meson

    - For the hibernate/suspend management we will use 'zzz' script gently provided by Leah Neukirchen

- Unitlogd development

- Unitlogctl development
