- Init process development
    - Wtmp and utmp management

      - Add 'install -m0664 -o root -g utmp /dev/null /var/run/utmp'
        in misc.sh. /var/run/utmp and /var/run/wtmp could be a macro path
      - In misc.sh we can invoke "halt -B" to write in wtmp and utmp (string reboot)
      - In hwclock we can invoke "halt -w" only wtmp (string shutdown)

    - Change seed generation. See seedrng! or provide both methods for backward compatibility

    - Virtualization

    - Release the oneshot initialization unit. (optimizing unitd daemon memory usage)

    - Review initialization and finalization scripts.
      Predict unitddatapath for the "run" property in the initial and final units.
      Replace it with unitddatapath macro value from meson

- Unitlogd development

- Unitlogctl development
