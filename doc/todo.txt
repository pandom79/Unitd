- Init process development
    - Unitctl analyze command. We can use "unitctl list" changing the source data.
      Predict a bool argument (isAnalyze or analyze).

    - Predict a notifier when the unit content is changed ???
      If the unit is into memory (state != Died) and the unit content is changed then we see wrong data.
      Affected functions are (list(requires, conflicts, states), and enable).
      Start, stop and disable are not affected by that.
      At least, we provide a message which say us to stop the unit and re-execute the operation.

    - For the hibernate/suspend management we will use 'zzz' script gently provided by Leah Neukirchen

- Unitlogd development

- Unitlogctl development
