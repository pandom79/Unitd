- Init process development
    - Small bug in parseProc cmdline. StringContains func could be match a wrong state

    - Show the error when we cannot enable unit because the wantedBy property doesn't match
      (default/cmdline, reboot and poweroff state)

      Predict a bool argument (isAnalyze or analyze).
